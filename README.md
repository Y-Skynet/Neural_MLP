# Neural_MLP
MLP_code entails Multi-Layer Perceptron implemented using Tensorflow for MNIST Dataset
The Autoencoder file entails an autoencoder linked to an MLP Network, it first compresses the dataset using an auto encoder(first training the Autoencoder network), then learns the parameters of the MLP network from the compressed train data and their corresponding class
not to mention the compressed train data is comming from the middle layer of the autoencoder network.
